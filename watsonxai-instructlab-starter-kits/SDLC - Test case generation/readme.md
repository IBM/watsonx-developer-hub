# Use case: Test case generation

In software development, test cases are specific scenarios used to verify that a software application or system behaves as expected. Each test case includes input conditions, execution steps, and expected results to ensure the code functions correctly. They are essential for identifying bugs, validating functionality, and maintaining code quality throughout development.

# Usage

This example uses a grounded skill to teach a model how to create test cases for a python function.
